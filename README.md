# Contact Management App

This project is a simple contact management application built with React. It allows users to add, edit, and delete contacts, storing the information in local storage.

## Features

- **Add Contact**: Enter a name, email, and phone number to create a new contact.
- **Edit Contact**: Update existing contact information in a popup.
- **Delete Contact**: Remove contacts from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: All contacts are stored in local storage, so they remain available even after refreshing the page.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [Create React App testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It optimally bundles React for production mode and minimizes the build size.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project, allowing you full control.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for most small and medium deployments.
